# Real-time Object Detection with TensorFlow.js

This repository contains a personal project demonstrating real-time object detection using TensorFlow.js. The project enables users to detect and classify multiple objects in live video streams, leveraging a pre-trained model.

## Features:
- **Webcam Integration**: Enable webcam access for real-time object detection directly within the browser.
- **IP Webcam Support**: Option to use both local and IP webcams for flexible video input sources.
- **Recording Capabilities**: Record and save video streams along with corresponding object detection data.
- **Data Visualization**: Visualize object detection results through bounding boxes and labels directly on the live video stream.

## Usage:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open `index.html` in a web browser.
3. Follow the instructions to enable webcam access and start real-time object detection.

## Getting Started:
To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps:

### Prerequisites:
- Web browser with webcam support
- Internet connection (for loading TensorFlow.js and pre-trained model)

### Installation:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/MDaniyalTariq/Realtime-Object-Detection-TensorFlowJS.git
